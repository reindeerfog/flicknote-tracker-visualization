# flicknote-tracker-visualization

This repository is mostly work done by [Thai "flicknote" Pangsakulyanont](https://github.com/dtinth/2012-beyondthenetwork-visualization), which contains the code that is used to generate [this fantastic YouTube video that visualizes the tracker song Beyond the Network used in Bejeweled II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frb3XMQCbOE).
Slightly modified for my own purposes to work for any tracker song, not just Beyond the Network.
